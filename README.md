# Computer Vision - MATLAB and Python Conversion
 
This repository contains course materials and python versions of the code for the course offered on Coursera.

## Table of content

- **Images for testing**:
	- `Image Processing for Engineering and Science/Data/`
	- `python-version/imdata/`

- **Course materials**: The folder `Image Processing for Engineering and Science/` contains files and materials from the course.

- **Course summary**: The folder `summary/` includes the course summary, divided into three text files.

- **Python analogs**: The `python-version/` folder contains Python versions of the course functions.

## Getting Started

### MATLAB (For Course)

To run MATLAB code provided in the course materials, follow there steps:

1. Install MATLAB running `matlab_R2023a_win64.exe` installer.
2. Ensure you have the necessary MATLAB licence.

### Python

To run python code you need to:
1. Install `anaconda`
2. Change default folder through terminal. The file `jupyter_cmds.txt` contains more info.

## Usage

The repository includes `Python Jupyter Notebook (ipynb)` files within the `python-version/` folder. These files attempt to replicate the functionality of MATLAB's methods used in the course.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have improvements, suggestions, or if you find errors or have constructive criticisms regarding the code, feel free to create pull requests or open issues.
